                As competition creates infinite choices, companies look for ways to
                connect emotionally with customers, become irreplaceable, and create
                lifelong relationships. A strong brand stands out in a densely crowded
                marketplace. People fall in love with brands, trust them, and believe in their
                superiority. How a brand is perceived affects its success, regardless of
                whether it’s a start-up, a nonprofit, or a product.

                Brand identity is tangible and appeals to the senses. You can
                see it, touch it, hold it, hear it, watch it move. Brand identity
                fuels recognition, amplifies differentiation, and makes big ideas
                and meaning accessible. Brand identity takes disparate
                elements and unifies them into whole systems.

                Branding is a disciplined process used to build awareness and extend
                customer loyalty. It requires a mandate from the top and readiness
                to invest in the future. Branding is about seizing every opportunity to
                express why people should choose one brand over another. A desire
                to lead, outpace the competition, and give employees the best tools to
                reach customers are the reasons why companies leverage branding.

                Seizing every opportunity to build brand champions requires identifying
                the constituencies that affect success. Reputation and goodwill extend
                far beyond a brand’s target customers. Employees are now called
                “internal customers” because their power is far-reaching. Gaining insight
                into stakeholder characteristics, behavior, needs, and perceptions yields
                a high return.
